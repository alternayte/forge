## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Huma for OpenAPI (not custom generation) — Best OpenAPI 3.1 from code in Go; avoids months of spec compliance work
- Atlas for migrations (not custom diffing) — Declarative schema diffing is multi-year effort; Atlas handles edge cases
- go/ast parsing (not compile-and-execute) — Solves bootstrapping; schemas parseable before gen/ exists
- Action layer shared by HTML + API — Prevents business logic duplication between Datastar and Huma handlers
- Scaffolded-once views (resources/) vs always-regenerated (gen/) — Clear ownership boundary

### Pending Todos
